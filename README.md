Just a hobby project in WPF (in the works)

This is an application which will ultimately function as a kind of unrestricted 2D space in which you can organize your thoughts visually (in the form of customized sticky-notes-sort-of-things and pictures). Bear in mind that app is in the early state of progress and it's more of a platform for learning than a full-scale project :)

Recently done:
- dynamically created, resizable and draggable sticky notes
- the ability to zoom in and out and freely move the canvas in which sticky notes are stored
- resizable main window
- automatic saving/loading via .bin files

Main things to do:
- enabling full drag and drop
- customization of sticky notes (colors, fonts etc.)
- ability to select a group of sticky notes and move them together
